Project Requirements
Description
We are developing a real-time speech-to-text transcription app using Flet and OpenAI Whisper. The app will provide users with the ability to transcribe their spoken words into written text in real-time. This is particularly useful for individuals who have difficulty typing or need to capture ideas quickly.

Requirements
The app has the following requirements:

Platform: The app should be developed for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.
Installation: The app should be easy to install and use, with clear instructions provided for the end-users.
Speech Recognition: The app should use Flet for speech recognition, which allows for high-quality transcription in real-time.
Transcription Accuracy: The app should provide accurate transcriptions, with a high level of accuracy.
Real-Time Transcription: The app should provide real-time transcription capabilities, allowing users to see their words appear on the screen as they speak.
User Interface: The app should have a clean and user-friendly interface, with easily accessible controls.
Output Formats: The app should provide users with the option to save transcriptions in multiple formats, including text and audio.
Integration with OpenAI Whisper: The app should be integrated with OpenAI Whisper, which will allow it to provide more accurate and contextually relevant transcriptions.
Performance: The app should be optimized for performance, providing fast and reliable transcription capabilities.
Security: The app should be developed with security in mind, with features such as encryption and user authentication to protect sensitive data.
Dependencies
The following libraries and packages are required to build and run the app:

cx_Freeze: A set of utilities for freezing Python scripts into executables.
Flet: A speech recognition library for Python that uses deep learning techniques.
PyAudio: A Python library for accessing audio input and output.
Torch: An open-source machine learning library.
OpenAI Whisper: A state-of-the-art language model for natural language processing.
Installation Instructions
To install the app, users should follow these steps:

Download the installation package for their operating system.
Run the installation package and follow the on-screen instructions.
Launch the app and start using it.
System Requirements
The app has the following system requirements:

Operating System: Windows, Mac, or Linux.
Processor: 2 GHz or faster.
RAM: 2 GB or more.
Hard Disk Space: 500 MB or more.
Future Improvements
In the future, we plan to add the following features to the app:

Support for Multiple Languages: The app will support multiple languages, allowing users to transcribe speech in languages other than English.
Enhanced User Interface: We will improve the user interface, making it more intuitive and customizable.
Speaker Recognition: The app will be able to recognize individual speakers and provide separate transcriptions for each speaker.
Integration with Other Services: We will integrate the app with other services, such as cloud storage providers, to provide users with more flexibility in saving and accessing their transcriptions.
